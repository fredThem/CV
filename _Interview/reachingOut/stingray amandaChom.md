Hi Amanda,

Hope you are doing well.

I recently applied to the role of Full Stack Web Developer at Stingray. Altough I am ready to move on from Bell Media, I am keen to stay in the music tech space and Stingray seems like a good fit.

I recently completed a full stack developper bootcamp. I was hoping you would be able to put in a word for me or to let me know who I can reach out to at Stingray to further disucss any upcoming opporunities

Thanks,
Fred
