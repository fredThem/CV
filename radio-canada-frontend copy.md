Salut Estelle,

J'espère que tu vas bien et que tu réussis à profiter de ce beau temps malgré tout.

Je t'écris aujourd'hui, car je viens tout juste de postuler pour le poste de Front-End Developer chez Radio-Canada. Suite à ton conseil à l'automne dernier, je me suis inscrit dans un bootcamp de développement  afin de peaufiner mes compétences techniques et je suis ravi de dire que celui-ci se terminera dans 2 semaines.

Je suis très motivé à me joindre à Radio-Canada, une Société que j'admire et pour laquelle je serais fier de travailler. Je suis confiant que les compétences en développement que j'ai acquises au cours de mon bootcamp ainsi que ma forte expérience à titre de designer web feront de moi un excellent ajout à votre équipe.

Au plaisir d'en discuter plus longuement.

Merci et bonne journée,
Frédéric Desmarais.
